# ML_PROJECT-02-Iris-Flower-Classification-Project-
ðŸŒ¼ The Iris dataset consists of measurements of three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Using the sepal and petal measurements, I developed a machine learning model that can accurately classify these flowers into their respective species. Achieved high accuracy in classifying Iris species.
